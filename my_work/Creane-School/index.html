                        <span class="para1">The saga of our school starts right from the year1937 when Fr. Lyons started to have contacts in Gaya and established a mission in the district. In 1940, Fr. James Creane was appointed as the first Priest in-charge of Gaya. Father had an intention to open a school and boysâ€™ hostel. He started the school in the year 1942, in a plot near Katari Hill Road. In 1943, Loreto sisters came to Gaya to establish Saint Mikhail School (Nazareth Academy) and one of them took over the responsibilities of our school as principal.</span><span class="para2"> After rendering their services to the school for about a year, they left Gaya and thereafter Sisters of Charity of Nazareth were requested to take over the charge of the school. Sr. N. Bernadit became the principal in the year 1944. Meantime in 1948, Fr. Creane died and after his sad demise the school was named after him in his memory. The school was under the tutelage of the Sisters till1990. 
                        In 1991, the baton was handed over to Fr. Jose Muthuplackal of Patna Archdiocese. At that time education was imparted to students up to Class V11.  Feeling the genuine need of the people, the then Archbishop Most Rev. Benedict J. Osta S.J was kind enough to upgrade the school to Class X. The school got affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education in the year 1994. The school was further upgraded to Senior Secondary level in 2004. Creane Kids Galaxy, a motherly home for kids was added to the school in 2005. The school is owned and administered by Gaya Parish society under the aegis of the Catholic Archdiocese of Patna and enjoys Minority status.</span>

                           School is precisely the place where the mind gets its nourishment with wisdom adorning it. We are all born equal; it's the education that makes a man. Dreams play a very significant roll in shaping the future. I often dream of this school of mine at Aundh, Pune. It's beautiful lush green lawns and inviting landscape generate freshness in the most prime location of the wonderful city of Gaya, the Oxford of the East. The school hosts enthusiasm and excitement of the bubbling young and the old, of the teacher and the taught. I investigate this school to be the dream school of every child in the city. I dream to be in the shoes of the old lady, totally committed to this wonderful transaction of wisdom and learning. I have a very firm conviction that my dream shall see its fulfillment, for I share this dream with the management of School.
